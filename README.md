The "AdaScape" package contains a simple adaptive speciation models written
in Python that can be easily coupled with a landscape evolution model (FastScape).

## Install

This package depends on Python (3.5 or later is recommended),
[numpy](http://www.numpy.org/),

and a [dendropy](https://dendropy.org/) extensions (optional dependencies).

To install the package locally, first clone this repository:

``` shell
$ git clone https://github.com/fastscape-lem/adascape.git
$ cd adaptive-speciation
```

Then run the command below (this will install numpy, scipy and pandas
if those libraries are not yet installed in your environment):

``` shell
$ pip install .
```

To install the package for development purpose, use the following
command instead:

``` shell
$ pip install -e .
```
